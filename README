This plugin will let the users access all new course updates (new or updated activity, new forum posts, and upcoming events) with ease. The plugin will fetch relevant data when the user logs in to his account and will show new activity in a notification bar on top of the page (just like facebook notification bar).
p.s: some java script functions may not work in Internet Explorer.
